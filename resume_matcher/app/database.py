Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM model for storing resume-to-job matching records
and provides a utility function to save matching results to the database.

    ORM model representing a single record of a resume vs. job description match.

    Attributes:
        id (Integer): Primary key for the record.
        resume_name (String): Name of the resume file.
        resume_file (LargeBinary): Binary data of the resume file.
        job_description (Text): Raw job description text.
        resume_info (Text): JSON-serialized metadata extracted from the resume.
        job_info (Text): JSON-serialized metadata extracted from the job description.
        comparison_scores (Text): JSON-serialized similarity scores or other comparison metrics.
        timestamp (DateTime): UTC timestamp when the record was created (defaults to now).

    '''
    Persist a new MatchRecord to the database.

    Reads the contents of the provided resume file, serializes resume/job metadata
    and comparison scores as JSON, and saves all information in a new database row.

    Parameters:
        resume_file (file-like): Open file object for the resume (must have a .name attribute).
        job_description (str): Raw text of the job description.
        resume_info (dict): Dictionary of metadata extracted from the resume.
        job_info (dict): Dictionary of metadata extracted from the job description.
        scores (dict): Dictionary containing similarity scores or other comparison metrics.

    Behavior:
        - Seeks to the beginning of the resume file to ensure full read.
        - Opens a new database session, creates a MatchRecord instance, and commits it.
        - Closes the session after the commit.
