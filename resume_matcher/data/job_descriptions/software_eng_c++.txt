Software Engineer C++

Our technology consists of our software suite MaxLab Live, a custom designed integrated circuit, and an FPGA-based data acquisition platform and generates vast amounts of data when electrically imaging neuronal tissue. Such data needs to be processed, analyzed and visualized online during operation. At the same time, our customers in drug discovery and neuroscience want to focus on their pharmaceutical and scientific questions, which requires to abstract and hide the technical complexity, while still providing sufficient flexibility to adapt the application to their specific needs. For this, we are seeking highly motivated software engineers to join our team and implement this challenging task.
